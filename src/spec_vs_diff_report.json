  "summary": "Diff implements backend authorization changes to allow authenticated principals (non-anonymous) to create lobbies via joinLobby and save profiles via saveCallerUserProfile, while trapping anonymous callers with clearer Unauthorized messages. Frontend LobbyView now gates Create New Lobby behind authentication and improves error toasts by extracting more specific messages from backend errors via a new utility.",

      "description": "Frontend now blocks lobby creation if the caller’s profile is not set up (requires completing profile setup first).",
      "reason": "REQ-14 only requires gating lobby creation on Internet Identity authentication, not on presence of a user profile; this adds an additional prerequisite for creating a lobby.",
