  "summary": "REQ-33 appears implemented by making Vite’s build output directory configurable via an environment variable while keeping the default as `dist`, and preserving `base: './'`. REQ-34 is partially implemented: the itch.io build doc mentions the default folder and an override mechanism, but the provided diff excerpt does not show the required instruction to zip the configured output folder (the one containing `index.html`). Additionally, the diff includes unrelated documentation/state-summary changes not requested by the BuildRequest.",
